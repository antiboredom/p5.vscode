//first, grab the updated p5js distribution by running:
./update-p5.sh    (will have to be on a mac for this, or do it by hand...)
OR update-p5js.py  (just need requests installed)


Then...
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
npm install typescript


Then, update the package.json file to an appropriate version number, then...
vsce package
vsce publish 1.7.0     (use whatever version number you choose in package.json)



If you instead want to try to automate the version number, you could use this instead, but would need to push the repo first.
vsce publish minor
